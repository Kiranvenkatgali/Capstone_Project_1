The traditional retail landscape has been altered by the introduction of the internet and the following growth of e- commerce. Nowadays, consumers have unheard-of access to a wide range of goods and services that cut beyond time and location barriers. Sites like Amazon have become significant players in this digital revolution, enabling an ecosystem where buyers and sellers may interact with previously unheard-of efficiency. Since its founding in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon has developed into more than just an online store. It is now a worldwide phenomena that influences market trends, shapes consumer tastes, and shapes how people shop. Understanding the complex subtleties of consumer behaviour within Amazon's eco system is crucial for companies looking to succeed in the fast-paced e-commerce sector as the company continues to broaden its offerings and reach. Businesses in the online retail sector rely heavily on consumer behavior analysis when making strategic decisions. Rapid changes are a defining feature of the landscape, driven by elements like changing economic situations, consumer expectations, and technological breakthroughs. In order to successfully navigate this environment, businesses must anticipate and adapt to the ever-changing needs and preferences of their target market. E-commerce's introduction has changed the face of traditional retail, emphasizing the importance of comprehending and analyzing customer behavior. The objective of this project is to use Microsoft Power BI's analytical skills to mine the abundance of data onAmazon in order to identify intricate patterns and trends in customer preferences. For companies looking for evidence-based solutions in the ever-changing realm of online retail, the study acts as a road map.
